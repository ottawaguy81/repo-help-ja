Branch Display
--------------

The branch display output by this command is organized into four
columns of information; for example:

 *P nocolor                   | in repo
    repo2                     |

The first column contains a * if the branch is the currently
checked out branch in any of the specified projects, or a blank
if no project has the branch checked out.

The second column contains either blank, p or P, depending upon
the upload status of the branch.

 (blank): branch not yet published by repo upload
       P: all commits were published by repo upload
       p: only some commits were published by repo upload

The third column contains the branch name.

The fourth column (after the | separator) lists the projects that
the branch appears in, or does not appear in.  If no project list
is shown, then the branch appears in all projects.

Options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
