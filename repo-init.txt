Description
-----------
The 'repo init' command is run once to install and initialize repo. The
latest repo source code and manifest collection is downloaded from the
server and is installed in the .repo/ directory in the current working
directory.

The optional -b argument can be used to select the manifest branch to
checkout and use. If no branch is specified, master is assumed.

The optional -m argument can be used to specify an alternate manifest to
be used. If no manifest is specified, the manifest default.xml will be
used.

The --reference option can be used to point to a directory that has the
content of a --mirror sync. This will make the working directory use as
much data as possible from the local reference directory when fetching
from the server. This will make the sync go a lot faster by reducing
data traffic on the network.

Switching Manifest Branches
---------------------------
To switch to another manifest branch, `repo init -b otherbranch` may be
used in an existing client. However, as this only updates the manifest,
a subsequent `repo sync` (or `repo sync -d`) is necessary to update the
working directory files.
